#summary Logo design using PonyGE

PonyGE's L-system and GUI components together allow the user to
interactively evolve images, and it's a lot of fun. It has been used
to create logos and submissions for a few image competitions, and so
far it has taken one prize in the UCD CASL cluster logo competition.
The following are four entries created for various categories in the
competition; the "Security & Trust" logo was a winner in its category.
The text was added manually using Inkscape.
