#summary How to install

= Dependencies =

Python would be handy.
If you want to run the GUI for interactively evolving graphics, you also need Tk. It's installed by default on most systems.

==Ubuntu==

For Python2, run:

{{{$ sudo apt-get install python-tk idle-python2.6}}}

For Python3, run:

{{{$ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-tk}}}

==Other Linux distros==

You know what to do.

==Mac==

Python3 is preferred. Get it from
the [http://www.python.org/download official download page].  If you don't want to install Python3, you can try using Python2, which is pre-installed on the Mac. Some people observe a
bug with it in which some mouse-clicks have no effect. Let us know. In either case, Tk will be installed along with it.

==Windows==

Get Python 2 or 3 from the [http://www.python.org/download official download page]. Tk will be installed along with it.
