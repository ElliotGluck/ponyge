- Make README in rst

- Use compile if the evolved function will be used multiple times

- Let fitness return tuples to allow e.g. parsimony preassure

- Enable line breaks in the rules when parsing, i.e. avoid everything on one line

- Print stats to file

- Add a cmdline parameter and code to set the save-directory (and make
  it automatically if necessary)

- Look at Rangoli: what are the rules? Can we learn from them?

- In L-systems, the main command which changes state without drawing
  is rotate (aka +/-). The key thing about this is, you can have lots
  of rotate commands either together, or spread out through the
  program. Rotation "wraps around", so if you have "too many" +
  commands, you just end up back at the start. This is a crucial
  property because it is in the nature of L-systems to sometimes give
  too many of a particular command. Our commands for colour and
  line-width should do the same. So we should have say 10 or 100
  gradations of colour (indices into a colour table, maybe) and when
  the index increases beyond that it should wrap around.

- Add Jennifer's PonyGE code as a branch.
